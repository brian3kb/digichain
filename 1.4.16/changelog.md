    - Basic note detection from filename for sorting the list.
    - Reworked layout for better rendering on smaller screen devices.
    - Added a light theme for users who don't like dark themes, toggled in the settings panel (first launch will set from the devices system color preference).
    - Custom filenames panel, add a list of custom filenames to use - once all names have been used, DigiChain will fall back to the default naming convention.

    - Allow disabling slice embed in settings.
    - Option to play pop-markers at the start and end of the sample for direct sampling to the Digitakt audio inputs.

- Split chained files at 12s (mono) or 20s (stereo) lengths mode. Sample order will loosely follow the list order, but it will try to fit smaller samples into the chain up to the max limit from further down the selected items in the list, so some samples may be out of order depending on their length and where they could be slotted into each chain to use up the time in the best way possible.
- Removing arraybuffers before removal of files to help free memory usage sooner.

    - Fixed bug where a non-standard wav file PAD chunk caused a page crash.
    - Adding a _n char/number to the end of duplicated files name (as exporting to zip overwrites same filename files).

2023-03-24 1.0.2
- When a slice grid length is selected, samples will now be auto-generated, (e.g. if you have 13 samples selected and a grid of 4, you will get 4 files downloaded instead of one chain of 13 samples [which isn't ideal for the Digitakt!]).
- Shift+click the slice-grid numbers to change the grid size, but retain the selected samples.
